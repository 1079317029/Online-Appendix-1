# Online-Appendix-1
we introduce the contents of Supplementary Table in the Online Appendix 1
Supplementary Table 1:Datasets
The category to which the tumor data belongs, the file name, and the acquisition link information.
Supplementary Table 2:Cancer driver
Our method identifies a result list of driver genes in the data set. Including the name of the gene, the type of cancer the gene belongs to, the location of the chromosome, and so on. WhereClusters represent the final number of clusters within the gene element. N_Ob_Clusters represents the number of mutations observed in the cluster, and its corresponding N_Sim_Clusters represents the number of mutations in the simulated mutation cluster.
Supplementary Table 3:Keywords of search
Search keywords used when CGC collects cancer-related gold labels.
Supplementary Table 4:Gold standard
Collated gold standard data, including only BRCA, UCEC, LGG, HNSC four cohort content.
Supplementary Table 5:Enrichment analysis
The results of enrichment analysis showed that the top 20 genes in each method were the driving genes of gold standard.
Supplementary Table 6:Mutation statistics
The number of samples and the number of single nucleotide mutations in the datasets.
